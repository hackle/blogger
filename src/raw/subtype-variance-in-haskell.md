Covariance is just a fancy way to say one thing changes in the same direction as another, and Contravariance, the opposite direction. For example, if 5 people are to evenly share some apples, then the more apples there are, the more apples each person will get. In this case, each person's share is covariant to the total of apples, as they increase or decrease together.

Now if we fix the number of apples, say, we have 20 apples only, then the more people there are to share amongst, the fewer each person will get. In this case, each person's share is contravariant to the number of people, as when the latter increases, the former decreases, and vice versa.

In programming with types, convariance and contravariance appear in different forms.
