With template literal types in TypeScript, we can make our own mini language, such as a strongly typed version of `printf`, that can be called as,

```TypeScript
printf('I am %s, %d years old, born in %D', arg1, arg2, arg3);
```

# Constructing, destructuring symmetry, and pattern matching

Ideally we want symmetric constructing and destructuring, or, something can be destructured the same way it's constructed.

This is actually true most of the time for values, for example maps `const { foo, bar } = { foo: 'foo', bar: 1 }`, or arrays / tuples `const [foo, bar] = ['foo', 'bar']`.

It should come as a pleasant surprise that such destructuring works equally well on type level. The trick is to use type inference (`extends + infer`) to destructure or pattern match.

```TypeScript
type FooType<T> = T extends { foo: infer F } ? F : never;

// must have number type
const fieldFoo: FooType<{ foo: number }> = 123;
```

# Pattern matching on literals

What is maybe less well-known, template literal types can be constructed in a similar way as string interpolation.

```TypeScript
type Mixed = `${number} ${boolean} ${string}`;

// must follow the format
const mixed: Mixed = "1 true friend";

// Type '"one TRUE friend"' is not assignable to type '`${number} false ${string}` | `${number} true ${string}`'.ts(2322)
const mixed1: Mixed = "one TRUE friend";
```

In search for symmetry, we will find it's also possible to pattern match on a string literal to recover its components. Here is a type `LeadingNumber` that extracts the leading number from a string literal:

```TypeScript
type LeadingNumber<T extends string> = 
    T extends `${infer N}${infer _}`
    ? N extends `${number}`
        ? N
        : never
    : never;

const leadingNumber: LeadingNumber<'1 true love'> = '1';

// Type '"2"' is not assignable to type '"1"'.ts(2322)
const leadingNumber2: LeadingNumber<'1 true love'> = '2';
```

Two things to note here,

- this actually is not completely symmetric as we can only recover `'1'` as a string, not as a number. I haven't figured out type-level coercion yet, if that's possible?

- pattern matching is lazy, proof being `` T extends `${infer N}${infer _}` `` alone is not enough to infer the leading number unless combined with the following `` N extends `${number}` ``.

# Recursive parsing

Throw in recursion we can do something quite interesting already. Here is a super strongly-typed `Split` that splits a string literal by a delimiter that's also a string literal.

```TypeScript
// D for delimiter
type Split<D extends string, T extends string> =
    T extends `${infer Head}${D}${infer Tail}`
    ? [Head, ...Split<D, Tail>]
    : [T];

const parts: Split<',', 'you,me,we'> = ['you', 'me', 'we'];

// Type '"yo"' is not assignable to type '"you"'.ts(2322)
const parts2: Split<',', 'you,me,we'> = ['yo', 'me', 'we'];
```

# printf

Now we are ready for the strongly-typed `printf`.

First thing first, let's agree on the terms: `%s, %d, %D` are called specifiers; the first string parameter to `printf` containing the specifiers is called the "format" or "template", to avoid confusion with the TypeScript type "template literal" let's call it "format". 

First we declare the specifiers to be supported. This is done with a map type that maps specifiers to their corresponding types (I know! It's a tongue twister).

```TypeScript
type Specifiers = {
    's': string,
    'd': number,
    'b': boolean,
    'D': Date
};

type Spec = keyof Specifiers;
```

And using the technique we've seen above to locate the specifier in the format string, once found, add the corresponding type to the result array of types. This is done recursively until there is no more specifiers found.

```TypeScript
type Values<T extends string> = 
    T extends `${infer _}%${infer K}${infer Rest}`
    ? K extends Spec
        ? [ Specifiers[K], ...Values<Rest> ]
        : Values<`${K}${Rest}`>
    : [];
```

Note it only works if we help the pattern matching by specifying the `%` symbol - my guess is otherwise it's hard to decide where to stop inferring `K` as it's sandwiched by two other inferences with no constraints or delimiters.

A couple of iterations later we are able to ignore unsupported patterns, and account for edge cases like `%%s`. Below is the `printf` in action.

```TypeScript
declare function printf<T extends string>(format: T, ...values: Values<T>): string;

const r = printf('this is a %s and it is %d %wyears old, right?%b %D %i %f', 'Hackle', 20, true, new Date());
```

Naturally we'll also want to restrict the return type to follow the format, other than being a plain `string`. This is done [here](https://github.com/hackle/blogger/blob/master/src/sample/printf.ts#L17).

This post is inspired by [the excellent typing for the react router](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react-router/index.d.ts#L154), and the "printf" example from [Idris](https://github.com/edwinb/Idris2/blob/master/tests/typedd-book/chapter06/Printf.idr), a truly dependent-typed language.
