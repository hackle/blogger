Hi - thanks for opening this blog. My name is Hackle Wayne, I am a software developer currently living in New Zealand.

"Between the abstractions we need and the abstractions we get" is a phrase I borrowed from the mighty and hilarious Erik Meijer, particularly, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKeHrApPWlo)

I am a programmer and I enjoy programming a lot. At work I use a lot of C# and TypeScript, but with my own time I particularly enjoy using (and learning, and learning with) languages such as Idris, Haskell, F#.

The setup of this blog is based on the excellent [serverless-haskell](https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell) project. You'll find a write-up for how I managed to wire everything up.

If you ever want to get in touch, this is my email address but reversed: moc.liamtoh@welkcah (you'll find an article dedicated to a ``reverse`` function in Idris)
