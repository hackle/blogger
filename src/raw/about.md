## about hackman

I must have borrowed the term "hackman" from a random friend - it's kind of catchy.

"Between the abstractions we need and the abstractions we get" is a phrase I borrowed the mighty and hilarvious Erik Meijer, particularly, this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKeHrApPWlo 

I am an experienced programming with (self-alleged) good command and experience in object-oriented programming, and currently endevouring to become proficient in the brave old world of functional programming, amongst a few other things.

In partciular I will share my learning on things such as

* Haskell
* F# 
* and the above applied to the AWS platform

The setup of this blog is based on the [serverless-haskell](https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell) project.

```haskell
    let x = 0:1:zipWith (+) x (tail x)
```
