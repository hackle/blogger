Hi - thanks for opening this blog. My name is Hackle Wayne, I am a software developer currently living in New Zealand.

"Between the abstractions we need and the abstractions we get" is a phrase I borrowed from the mighty and hilarious Erik Meijer, particularly, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKeHrApPWlo)

I am a programmer and I enjoy programming a lot. At work I use a lot of C# and TypeScript, but with my own time I particularly enjoy using (and learning, and learning with) languages such as Idris, Haskell, F#.

The setup of this blog is based on the excellent [serverless-haskell](https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell) project. You'll find a [write-up](/how-is-this-blog-put-together) for how I managed to wire everything up.

If you ever want to get in touch, this is my email address but reversed: moc.liamtoh@welkcah (you'll find an article dedicated to a ``reverse`` function in Idris). Or find me on Twitter [@hacklew](https://twitter.com/hacklew).

## Pragmatic unit testing now!

This is a workshop that I can run for your team to introduce a few very simple ideas and techniques to make unit testing more useful, fun and practical.

It was run at [NDC Oslo](https://ndcoslo.com/speaker/hackle-wayne/)!

## Speaking and talks

I am available for speaking at conferences, meetups or workplaces when there is genuine interest. Below are some of the current topics,

### A few things about unit testing

### Immutability for free! (use lens in TypeScript for the win)
### You are but one key word away from functional programming
