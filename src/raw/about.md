Hi - thanks for opening this blog. My name is Hackle Wayne and "hackman" is one of those things that I have no idea when I picked up - but it's kind of catchy.

"Between the abstractions we need and the abstractions we get" is a phrase I borrowed from the mighty and hilarious Erik Meijer, particularly, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKeHrApPWlo)

I am a programmer and I enjoy programming a lot. At work I use a lot of C# and TypeScript, but with my own time I particularly enjoy using (and learning) Haskell and the likes of F#.

The setup of this blog is based on the excellent [serverless-haskell](https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell) project. You'll find a write-up for how I managed to wire everything up.

If you ever want to get in touch, this is my email address but reversed: moc.liamtoh@welkcah
