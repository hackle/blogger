The CAP theorem describes a phenomenon in distributed databases: out of Consistency, Availability and Partitioning, only two can be guaranteed at the same time. You'll find a complete definition on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem). Here let's use an example: for data security, I save all data in 2 copies, each copy in its own database instance.

* Partition tolerance: the application should survive failure of one of the database instances (but not both).
* Consistency: any piece of data is always identical across these two database instances.
* Availability: 

Give-away: choosing a database? Look at consistency first.

It governs flow of information or communication.

Analogy? Cheap, good and fast?

Software: Scope, speed and quality?

Organisation: autonomy, process and delivery?
